I am a PhD student in the [Large-Scale Data & Systems Group](https://lsds.doc.ic.ac.uk/) at [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/), under the supervision of [Dr. Peter Pietzuch](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~prp/). My research at Imperial will focus on the interplay between Dataflow Systems and novel Deep Learning use-cases.
Before Imperial, I was a Research Engineer at the TU Delft's [Web Information Systems Group](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/web-information-systems/) working on [Clonos](https://delftdata.github.io/clonos-web/) and a student at the [NOVA School of Science and Technology](https://www.fct.unl.pt/en).
