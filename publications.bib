abstract = {Stream processing lies in the backbone of modern businesses, being employed for mission
critical applications such as real-time fraud detection, car-trip fare calculations,
traffic management, and stock trading. Large-scale applications are executed by scale-out
stream processing systems on thousands of long-lived operators, which are subject
to failures. Recovering from failures fast and consistently are both top priorities,
yet they are only partly satisfied by existing fault tolerance methods due to the
strong assumptions these make. In particular, prior solutions fail to address consistency
in the presence of nondeterminism, such as calls to external services, asynchronous
timers and processing-time windows. This paper describes Clonos, a fault tolerance
approach that achieves fast, local operator recovery with exactly-once guarantees
and high availability by instantly switching to passive standby operators. Clonos
enforces causally consistent recovery, including output deduplication, by tracking
nondeterminism within the system through causal logging. To implement Clonos we re-engineered
many of the internal subsystems of a state of the art stream processor. We evaluate
Clonos' overhead and recovery on the Nexmark benchmark against Apache Flink. Clonos
achieves instant recovery with negligible overhead and, unlike previous work, does
not make assumptions on the deterministic nature of operators.},
